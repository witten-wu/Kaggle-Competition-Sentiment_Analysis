### Goal
This project is to predict the sentiment of Tweets about four technology companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter. Here are some examples of tweets with different sentiments:

positive: "http://t.co/QV4m1Un9 Forget the phone.. Nice UI. Liking the Scroll Feature #android #google #nexus"
negative: "Have never had such poor customer service at @Apple before! What happened? (@ Apple Store w/ 2 others) http://t.co/GKlXMUi6"
neutral: "The lock screen now has facial recognition capability! #Google #Android #ICS".
Your goal is to train a classifier to predict whether a tweet is positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
